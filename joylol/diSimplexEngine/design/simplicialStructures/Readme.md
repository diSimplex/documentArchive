# Simplicial structures

## Problem

DiSiTT is based on transfinite simplicial structures.  That is 
collections of transfinite simplicies. When the dust settles and we 
have Category theory, a Simplicial Structure is nothing other than a 
Functor in the Functor Category of PreSheves built on the opposite 
category of the Ordinals.

However to build the Ordinals we only need 1-simplicial structures, so 
we begin there.

## Goals

Start by building 1-simplicial structures. 

## Requirements

> A Simplicial Structure MUST have a (possibly empty) collection of 
> 0-simplicies

> A Simplicial Structure MUST have a (possibly empty) collection of 
> 1-simplicies
