# diSimplexEngine feature backlog

This directory contains a collection of prospective features which have 
not yet been accepted for a given sprint.

This collection of features represents desired features/goals together 
with their testable scenarios which collectively describe the project.

As such, this collection of feature files, will grow as new goals are 
identified and shrink as these features get selected to be implemented 
in one or more sprints.

Once a given feature is selected for a given sprint, the feature file 
will be moved to an appropriate subdirectory of the features directory.

The features contained in this backlog are **NOT** expected to be 
complete features.

In particular they are really only markdown text files describing a 
given story.

However each feature file should contain:

 * a good high-level description, 
 * a "story", of what that feature should do
 * together with some justification as to why doing it is important.

Each story should contain:

 * what will happen (the action),
 * who will be doing the action,
 * who will want the action to happen,
 * what "business value" will be achieved by doing the action.
