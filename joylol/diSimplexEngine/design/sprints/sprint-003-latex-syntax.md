# Sprint 003 LaTeX syntax

* overlaps with all 003 sprints
* Started: 2014/09/26 

## Objectives

Our primary objective is to provide LaTeX resources (texStyles) with 
which to *write* *about* the DiSiTT engine.

A secondary objective is to provide a bridge from "classical" 
mathematical notations to the raw syntax of the DiSiTT engine.

A subsequent objective is to understand the modular structure of 
DiSiTT, as it relates to the "classical" mathematical notations.
