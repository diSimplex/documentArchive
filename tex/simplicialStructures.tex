\begin{abstract}
%
Our eventual goal is to study the topology of space-time.  At a basic 
level, space-time is, in fact, directed rather than homogeneous. We 
base our study of directed topology on directed simplicial structures 
and their associated automorphisms.

\section{Introduction}

\TODO{Of particular importance for our work is to explore the appropriate
logical factorization system of the classical topos of presheaves, $[
\Cardinal^{op}, \Set ]$. See \cite[Definition 4.3.2; page 136]{jacobs2012coalg}.
This logical factorization system provides us with the ``logic'' required for
Directed Simplicial Type Theory. }
