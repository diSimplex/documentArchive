# JoyLoL

A Joy(ful) concatenative programming language based on Lists of Lists

We provide an implementation of JoyLoL written in itself. JoyLoL is a 
form of [Manfred von Thun's Joy programming 
language](http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/research-projects/past-projects/joy-programming-language) 
which is restricted to manipulating Lists of Lists.
